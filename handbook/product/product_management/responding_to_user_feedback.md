# Responding to user feedback 

The product team owns a number of [user feedback sources](../user_feedback.md). 

## Feedback rotation

A single product manager owns the general feedback channels for 2-4 weeks at a time, and then rotates this responsibility to the next-in-line product manager. 

The [feedback workflow doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTRjK-CL38fdCvrVUgRL70agUiwDbQFJXCo8IuJmLls/edit#) lists the current responder. 

### NPS Feedback

### Github issues created by third parties

We label and forward issues that others create to the right teams, because those outside the Sourcegraph GitHub organization cannot add labels. [This GitHub search](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+no%3Alabel+is%3Aopen) is a fast way to find these issues. 

## Browser uninstall form feedback

See the [browser uninstall feedback section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTRjK-CL38fdCvrVUgRL70agUiwDbQFJXCo8IuJmLls/edit#bookmark=id.hmb2g29ltsnr) of the feedback workflow doc.
