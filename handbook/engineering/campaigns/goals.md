# Campaigns goals

## Design and build the best experience for creating changesets across many repositories

Campaigns need to be easy to explain, easy to understand, easy to get started, and easy to explore.

How do we do this:
  * Clean conceptual model
  * Excellent docs, tutorials, demos/training
  * Expressive syntax
  * Best debugging experience

Our success metrics:
  * TBD

## Build the best solution for managing large numbers of changesets

Much of the work in completing a large scale change across many repos is in getting the changesets merged. We want to be the best tool for all aspects of changeset management.

How do we do this:
  * Help users understand the overall status of their campaign
  * Provide tools to find and resolve problematic changesets
  * Provide flexible tools to prompt reviewers and owners to merge the created changesets in whatever way best suits the customer
  * Integrate with issue tracking systems

Our success metrics:
  * Seconds from changeset create to changeset merged

## Increase the scope of campaigns

Today, campaigns are intended for creating changesets in many owned repositories on a few code hosts. Eventually, we want to increase the scope of what we intend campaigns to be used for.

How do we do this:
  * Add support for monorepos
  * Enable campaigns on open source projects
  * Add support for other code hosts

Our success metrics:
  * TBD

## Improve quality and stability 

Campaigns need to be rock-solid, dependable, and robust.

How do we do this:
  * Automated end-to-end testing

Our success metrics:
  * TBD

## Grow adoption of campaigns

We need to make it as easy as possible for new customers to try out campaigns:

How do we do this:
  * Proactive customer outreach
  * Frictionless initial experience
  * Continual user validation to determine our roadmap
  * Discoverability of campaigns through sourcegraph.com and OSS campaigns

Our success metrics:
  * [Looker dashboard with usage metrics](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/dashboards/136) (internal only)

Milestones:
  * Build a base of 10 customers who have created 80 campaigns and made 4000 changesets in Q4
